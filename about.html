            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Nice, seaport city, Mediterranean tourist centre, and capital of Alpes-Maritimes department, Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur region, southeastern France. The city is located on the bay of Anges, 20 miles (32 km) from the Italian border. Sheltered by beautiful hills, Nice has a pleasant climate and is the leading resort city of the Côte d Azur, or French Riviera.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded by the Phocaeans of Marseille (a colony of Greek mariners) around 350 BCE, the city was probably named in honour of a victory (nikē in Greek) over a neighbouring colony. Conquered by the Romans during the 1st century CE, it became a busy trading station. The town was held by the counts of Provence during the 10th century, and in 1388 passed under the protection of the counts of Savoy, who held it until 1860, although it was captured and occupied several times by the French during the 17th and 18th centuries. Nice was ceded to France by the Treaty of Turin (1860), after which a referendum ratified the decision.</p>

            <h2>Historical Museums</h2>
            <p>The Musée Jules Chéret and the Musée Masséna have collections of early Italian paintings and works by 19th-century and contemporary artists. A memorial to the painter Marc Chagall has been built to house a collection of biblical paintings donated by the artist in 1966. A mile northeast of the city centre is the ancient episcopal town of Cimiez, which contains the majestic ruins of a Roman amphitheatre. Nearby stands a 17th-century villa housing an archaeological museum and a collection of more than 40 paintings and drawings by the French artist Henri Matisse.</p>

            <h2>France, Nice</h2>
            <p>Nice has a long history of tourism, both in summer and winter, and it is one of the citys principal economic activities. Apart from the beaches and yachting harbour, tourism is stimulated by Nices cultural facilities, shops, and architectural heritage; business tourism is also of considerable importance, based on the Acropolis Congress Centre and associated exhibition halls. In addition, numerous events and festivals are organized each year, notably the Carnival of Nice, which dates from 1873, but also including the open tennis tournament. </p>
